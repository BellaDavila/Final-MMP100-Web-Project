            Close your eyes and tan on your towel taking in the sounds of a lazy pool day! 
            I used 8 different samples that I combined, including one of my own samples. The only effect I manually did on Audacity was a fade in and fade out. The most 
            challenging part was coming up with the idea, and using the correct sounds and samples to make it as realistic as possible.
