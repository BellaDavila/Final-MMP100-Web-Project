            Welcome to my portfolio containing all the different media projects I worked on/created this Spring Semester
            of 2025. I'm currently a Marketing major and it was
            really interesting to see the "behind-the-scenes" aspect of Marketing. I'm not the most tech savvy gal but thoroughly enjoyed creating all these different projects and
            learned a lot. Please enjoy!
