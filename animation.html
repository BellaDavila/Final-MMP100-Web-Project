                This is my animation based off of the emotion "Wonder." I imported both a moon and stars from Pexels to 
                add a more realistic feel to my project and then added illustrated asteroids/rockets.
               I also created shapes to make my “space” even more real. I still wanted a hint of cartoon 
                elements therefore I added the stars that you will see get bigger and smaller. The most challenging thing for me  was just getting all the 
                different elements in the positions that I wanted to work cohesively, but I honestly had a lot of fun with the project!
